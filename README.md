# Laravel E-commerce Project
This is one of my school projectsâ€”a simple Laravel-based e-commerce application.

# Setup Instructions:
Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the GitHub repository.
2. Import the provided SQL file into phpMyAdmin. (Assuming you are using XAMPP as your local development environment.)
3. If you intend to perform CRUD operations on products, delete the "Storage" folder located in the "public" directory. Afterwards, run the following command to create a symbolic link: `php artisan storage:link`
4. Launch the Laravel development server by executing the command: `php artisan serve`

By following these steps, you should have the Laravel e-commerce project up and running successfully.
